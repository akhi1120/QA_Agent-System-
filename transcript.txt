Today we're going to show you how to automate the process of creating interviews, conducting resume based screening, and even executing first round video interviews using AI. The first step is to create an interview. This can be done in two easy steps. First, provide the job description. Once you've done that, the AI will suggest questions based on the job description. You can customize these questions and then establish the interview. For users of the advanced plan, there's an extra step where you can select an AI avatar. This ensures that the lip syncing aligns with the script. Let's start with the first step. If you already have a job description, enter it here. If you don't have a description, but you do know the job title, such as looking for a 2-year experienced JavaScript developer with AWS experience, you can use the enhanced JD feature. The AI will generate a complete job description for you. If you want, you can prefill and edit the job description. Once you've saved the job description, you'll start seeing some skill recommendations. The AI extracts key skills from the job description as the entire automation of the interview process depends on this skill set. The interview questions, assessments, and scoring are all based on these skills. So, it's crucial to choose the right ones. You can pick from the skills suggested by the AI or you can add your own. Make sure you provide an accurate representation of the required skills. For instance, you might specify two years of experience in AWS. Next, decide on the difficulty level of the questions, hard, moderate, etc. The title should already be populated. Begin by inputting the company's name and allow the AI to analyze your job description, subsequently suggesting relevant questions. You'll observe two categories of questions, standard and role-based. Standard questions are generally consistent across all interviews you create. These questions are typically objective, such as, "What's the notice period?" Feel free to personalize the options for each question. If there's a preferred answer, simply check the box next to it. This assists the AI in prioritizing applicants who provide these answers. We accommodate all types of questions, and you're certainly free to add your own standard ones. Coding questions will be coming soon. If you desire to remove any questions, you have the option to delete them and reorder the sequence. The AI will also generate role-based questions and it's aware of the preferred answer for these as well. At this stage, the system compares the user's responses with the ideal answers for a more accurate ranking. If you wish to modify this, you can change both the question and the ideal answer. You can tailor the questions to suit your needs. Once you've made the necessary changes, simply click on the create option. And there you have it. The interview is created. The first thing you'll notice is the unique public interview link. This link is exclusive to each interview based on the job description and other details you provided. If you're advertising your job on platforms like Indeed, Noy, etc., this link can serve as your application form link. Interested candidates can visit the provided link and fill in their details. From there, our AI system takes over. It begins by verifying the candidates's email address using an OTP. Once verified, the AI proceeds to review the resume. If you've enabled the résé based threshold, the AI will assess the ré score. If the candidate meets the threshold, they proceed to the video interview stage immediately. If they don't, they are informed that the position may not be a good fit for them. This process allows candidates to apply and be screened through resumes and video interviews automatically, saving you considerable time and effort. Once you start sharing the public link, all you need to do is visit the responses tab to view the candidates's responses. You can fully view structured answers and video recordings along with scores and resumes in the responses section. If you desire a detailed scoring, you can directly visit the section interview screenings where you'll find AI analyze scores. Let's use this individual as an example. She has completed a video interview. Here we can see her skills versus her scores. What is her interview score? What is her communication score? The AI also provides a comprehensive summary of the interview, noting observations, positives, and negatives. We've added an action button here allowing you to either select or reject the candidate. Second way is using ré screening. If you have a set of résumés that you want to screen against a job description, create an interview and upload all the résumés. Upon submission, the AI will commence the screening process. The unique aspect of this approach is that it doesn't solely rely on resumeé similarity. Instead, it evaluates candidates primarily on their skills, providing a realistic assessment of the candidates's experience in relation to the job description. The system conducts a comprehensive semantic analysis and assigns a ré score. The key consideration is the suitability of the resume and whether the AI recommends the profile for the next stage. For example, a candidate might have experience with some required skills and score higher yet the AI might not recommend them. This could be because despite the high score, their experience doesn't fully align with the overall job requirements. This is where the AI recommendations truly shine. Once you see this recommendation, you can decide whether to reject the candidate or advance them to the next round. If you decide to proceed, you can send them an interview link, which can be valid for 24 hours. Candidates can then submit their interview at their convenience. Once they've submitted their interview, you can initiate the interview screening process and start reviewing the summary. That's it. Hope you enjoyed the demo.
